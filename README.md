# Marquee Banner Shopify Section

I am always working on different snippets/sections for cool projects and wanted to share some that I find useful

I decided to keep all the code within the one file just for ease of the end user, however if I was working on this as part of a project I would split the file up to have the CSS within a stylesheet and the JavaScript within a .js file

Feel free to use this code within your projects and update the code as needed to change things
## How to use
Open the Shopify theme editor and create a new section file called marquee-banner.liquid

You'll then be able to use this within the Theme Customiser like you would any other Shopify section

The blocks can be used to add the text and the section settings is where all of the customisation takes place
